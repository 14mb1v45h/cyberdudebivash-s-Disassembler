# This tool relies solely on standard Python libraries:
# - tkinter (for GUI)
# - os, binascii, struct (for file handling and hex)
# - msilib (optional, for MSI on Windows; part of standard library)

# No external pip-installable dependencies are required.
# If you encounter issues with tkinter, ensure your Python installation includes it (common on most distributions).
